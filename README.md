# Lab1 - Creating an Image!
I've made the code to create a circle in cpp!

## How to use

```
Download the repository
```
```
run Lab1/lab1/Debug/Lab1.exe
```
```
open Circle.ppm (my code creates and exports to a ppm file in the code itself)
no need to do lab1.exe > circle.ppm!
```

## Thoughts
you can look before hand and see that there should not be a Circle.ppm file.
The other Circles (Circle2 and Circle3) where made when I was debugging.

I left them there in case you wanted to view them!
